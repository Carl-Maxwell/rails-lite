# Rails Lite

This is a project that I made as part of the App Academy curriculum,
       learning more about how rails works by creating a simulacrum.


To run the server do:

```bash
cd rails-lite
bundle
wallhack server
```

It also provides a command line interface (similar to `rails console`)

```
wallhack console
```
